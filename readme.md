### **Support Opensource**

Developing and maintaining open-source and free projects requires a significant commitment of time and effort. My goal is to transition to working on open-source projects on a full-time basis. If you'd like to support me and the open-source community consider making a small donation. You can have your logo/name on this [page](https://atmailwin.com/support/) .
